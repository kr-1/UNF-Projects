This program is an exercise in javafx. In it, a rectangle bounces across the pane, the speed of its animation is controlled with a slider. My name appears in the pane, and its font can be bolded or italicized using checkboxes, and the color of the text can be changed with radio buttons. Its position in the frame can be moved up or down using two buttons. There is also a video player in the middle of the plane which plays a very humorous video of my cat fighting a feather duster. The video can be controlled with a play button and a rewind button, and its volume can be controlled with a slider. (Note: the video no longer appears in the program as its URL is now outdated.)
